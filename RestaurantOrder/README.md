**Description**

This was my final project for my course CSCI1130 - Introduction to Programing in Java at North Hennepin Community College in Fall 2019.

This Java GUI application will allow customers to order food from one of my favorite restaurants, Famous Dave's, and get estimated wait time and prices for their orders.

**Instruction**

* Download all the source code and run Main.java in one of the Java IDE. IntelliJ IDEA IDE is recommended.
